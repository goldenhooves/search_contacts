== Javascript Search constructor
The idea here was to create a reusable search constructor where you pass in
a bunch of details and the search would look after the rest.

This could be improved by:
    * Refining what elements are required to be passed into the search Construtor  
    * Waiting for the data to return successfully before allowing searches 
    * Scoping the search to certain fields
    * Adding ability to pass in field hierarchy
    
I would also normally have written some rails tests
